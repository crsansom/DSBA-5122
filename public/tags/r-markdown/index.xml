The Museum has a large main gallery with rotating exhibits covering Charlotte history from the Revolutionary War through today. There are other preserved historic structures on the property, most notably, the Hezekiah Alexander House which is a restored farmhouse built in 1774 and is the oldest surviving structure in Mecklenburg County.</description>
